This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Directions

Your goal is to build a website component in Next.js using a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

1. Build a component consistent with the design (see screenshot and design below)
2. Retrieve the questions and answers from the `db.json` file located in the `_data` folder using the provided `json-server` package and `FetchData` component.
3. Add an `id` to each question and answer set found in the json file and use the index to sort the questions in chronological order
4. Your code should be able to handle additional FAQs added in teh future
5. The answers should be hidden by default and revealed when the user clicks the question
6. Show off your CSS skills and include some animations if possible

_Some baseline styles and brand colors have been provided as well as an SVG image from the design._

### The Design

The design file can be viewed here: https://www.figma.com/file/qM1evJc5mx2Pw6J6gkNnTk/Dev-Task-Design?type=design&node-id=1%3A7&mode=design&t=FDPoBROl4DgY9O8c-1

<div style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); padding: 10px;">ðŸ¤« Hint: Use Figma dev mode to get specifics on styles and colors</div>

### Data Fetching

This project includes a json file in the `_data` folder. To use it install [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and run `json-server --watch --port 4000 ./_data/db.json`.

### Rules

Use any resources at your disposal aside from AI tools. Google, Stackoverflow, and other web resources are all at your disposal. You can reach out to the interviewers with questions as well.
